<h1>Haaaave you met Red?</h1>

I've been writing for so long, that I actually forgot how to introduce myself. 

<div class="content-img" style="width: 50%">
  <img src="/img/meme_refusestoelaborate_publishesblog.png" alt="haters will say it's photoshop">
  <p class="img-alt">
    "haters will say it's photoshop"
  </p>
</div>

I'm a dev that likes C, NodeJS, Ruby, and lately Rust. I like the philosophy of (programming) languages, and all the dirty secrets that hide behind a compiler.

This tech blog is here because I want to write about some stuff I do.
